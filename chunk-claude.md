Review the CLAUDE.md in this repository.

It is bloated! 

Work through these tasks:

## Prune 

- Reduce it to the minimum length possible for an AI agent to gain the essential details of this project.  Consider "essential details" to mean enough information to gain foundational context about the project and understand the key purpose of the repository or codebase.

## Nest 

Assuming that you find extraneous information (detail in CLAUDE.md that may be helpful to an agent but which isn't immediately necessary) you should do as follows:

- Create a folder called agent-context 
- Within this folder, create individual files for specific aspects of the context data you had captured. Each specific file should have a descriptive file name.

Once done, you should reference agent-context in CLAUDE.md. 

For example:

- More specific context data to assist with this project can be found in the agent-context folder. Review the files before asking the user questions.
